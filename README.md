# Life Expectancy and the Test of Blue Zones

This Git Hub repository holds supporting data collection, data cleaning, and data modeling for the project "Life Expectancy and the Test for Blue Zones" [here](https://sites.google.com/colorado.edu/life-expectancy-and-blue-zones/introduction).

This project focuses on exploring the global patterns in life expectancy and review it under the lens of Blue Zones. Blue zones are considered areas where people live longer than other due to healthier lifestyles. This project reviews public data available on life expectancy and its association with factors within the pillars of Chronic Illness, Alcohol Consumption, Public Health, Government Support, and more. 

This repository will host the data sources (in their raw and cleaned formats), exploratory data analysis and eventually modeling performed on the data.
